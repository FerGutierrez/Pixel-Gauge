Pixel-Gauge
===========

<h2 style="color:red;">Obsolete. See <a href="https://github.com/FerGutierrez/pxGauge/>pxGauge</a>

<p>Measurment tool for distances in pixels inside websites.
Originally it is just supposed to be a snippet, so if you paste it in a site you are working on, or in jsfiddle, jsbin,...you can portotype a bit faster and compare cross-browser responses.</p>
<p>Simply drag the rays to about the limits you want to measure, then fine-adjust with the arrow keys (the ray hovered will move 1px per key stroke). You can choose between 4 colours for the rays in the control panel.</p>
<p>Please, see "issues" for Cross-Browser bugs.</p>
