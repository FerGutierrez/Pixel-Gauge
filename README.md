Pixel-Gauge
===========

Measurment tool for distances in pixels inside websites.
Originally it is just supposed to be a snippet, so if you paste it in a site you are working on, or in jsfiddle,bin,...you can portotype a bit faster and compare cross-browser responses.
Please, see "issues" for Cross-Browser bugs.
