Pixel-Gauge
===========

<p>Measurment tool for distances in pixels inside websites.
Originally it is just supposed to be a snippet, so if you paste it in a site you are working on, or in jsfiddle,bin,...you can portotype a bit faster and compare cross-browser responses.</p>
<p>Simply drag the rays to about the limits you want to measure, then fine adjust with the arrow keys (the ray hovered will move 1px per key stroke). You can choose between 4 colours for the rays in the control panel.</p>
<p>Please, see "issues" for Cross-Browser bugs.</p>
